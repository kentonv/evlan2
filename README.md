# Evlan v2

A long long time ago, before I had ever even had a real job, I designed a programming language called Evlan. If you're lucky, you might be able to read the ancient web site at http://evlan.org (but the server isn't always up because, uh... the server is written in Evlan, and maintaining decade-old software proves surprisingly difficult).

Later, while working at Google in 2009-ish, I spent some time working on a new version of Evlan as a 20% project. This version was going to be a "distributed functional programming language", seamlessly supporting functional programming across a cluster of machines.

I never had a chance to get this side project into a useful state. When I left Google, they were happy to let me take the code with me. So this is the code dump.

This code is supposed to build using [ekam](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/ekam). But it doesn't really work in its present state.
